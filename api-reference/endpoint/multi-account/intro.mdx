## What is Multi-Account?

The **Multi-Account** feature allows a single organization (the _parent_) to create and manage additional, independent organizations (\*sub-organizations\* or _child accounts_). Each sub-organization is treated as a distinct entity, with its own data, spending, and settings â€” but still tied to the parent for oversight and control.

> ### How it works 

- A **parent organization** can create multiple **sub-organizations**.

- Each **sub-organization** operates independently:

  - Has its own settings

  - Tracks its own transactions or spending

  - Can have its own users and permissions

  - Introduction of funds Allocation and De-Allocation

- The parent organization retains visibility and high-level control across all its sub-accounts.

## 

## Who is it for?

- Enterprises with multiple subsidiaries
- SaaS platforms offering account-based services
- Developers building apps that support multi-tenancy
