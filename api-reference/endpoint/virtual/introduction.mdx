## What is  Sub-Account?

The _Sub-Account_ feature allows a single organization (the parent) to create and manage additional, independent organizations (sub-organizations or sub-accounts). Each sub-organization is treated as a distinct entity, with its own data, spending, and settings â€” but still tied to the parent for oversight and control.

> ### How it works

- A _parent organization_ can create multiple _sub-accounts_.
- Each _sub-accounts_ operates independently:
  - Has its own settings
  - Tracks its own transactions and spending
  - Can have its own users and permissions
  - Introduction of funds Allocation and De-Allocation
  - Tracks its own allocations or de-allocations
  - Deposit funds independently
- The parent organization retains visibility and high-level control across all its sub-accounts.

## Who is it for?

- Enterprises with multiple subsidiaries
- Fintechs offering multi-currency feature
- Businesses opening virtual banking accounts for multiple merchants
- SaaS platforms offering account-based services
- Developers building apps that support multi-tenancy
