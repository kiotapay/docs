## **API Architecture & Design Principles**

Our API is designed to follow **RESTful** principles, ensuring it is easy to integrate, scalable, and maintainable. Here’s an overview of the key architectural features:

### 1. **Statelessness**:
Every API request contains all the necessary information (e.g., authentication, parameters) to process the request. This makes it easier to scale and provides better fault tolerance.

### 2. **Resource-Oriented**:
Each API endpoint is designed to represent a specific resource (e.g., transactions, customers). The endpoints are logically grouped to ensure a clean and organized structure, enhancing readability and ease of use.

### 3. **Security**:
Security is a top priority. All communication with the Kiotapay API is encrypted using **TLS** (Transport Layer Security). We also implement **OAuth2.0** for authentication and authorization, ensuring that only authorized users can access sensitive resources.

### 4. **Versioning**:
The API follows a clear versioning strategy, allowing backward compatibility with older versions while introducing new features and improvements. This ensures that integrations are not disrupted by updates.

### 5. **Error Handling**:
Our API returns meaningful error messages with appropriate HTTP status codes. For example, if a request is invalid, the response might be a `400 Bad Request` with a message explaining what went wrong.

### 6. **Rate Limiting**:
To protect the API from abuse and ensure fair usage, we have implemented **rate limiting**. Requests are throttled based on the rate limits set per endpoint, ensuring that no user can overwhelm the system.
